<h1><a name="3.1">3.1 Definition</a></h1>
<p>
A <b>Battler</b> refers to a generic entity that fights in battles. This includes the Player,
all members of his/her <a href="#3.6">Party</a> and their <a href="#3.7">Enemies</a>.
The behavoir and capabilities of each Actor are determined by the factors described below.
</p>
<h2>3.1.1 Personal Details</h2>
<p>
Personal Details are factors that are considered "intagible". They are presented in the form of 
strings on the front-end, but these correspond to some back-end values that affect each Battler's
Attributes. Only a few of these can be changed under special circumstances.
</p>
	<h3>3.1.1.1 Name</h3>
<p>
The name of the Battler. The Player can choose to enter the name when making the Battler or allow a randomly generated name (six character limit).
</p>
	<h3>3.1.1.2 Race</h3>
<img src="files/icons/human.png">
<img src="files/icons/monster.png">
<img src="files/icons/golem.png">
<p>
The race of the Battler. Battler can be Human/Monster/Golem/Hero(ine).
</p>
	<h3>3.1.1.3 Gender</h3>
<img src="files/icons/male.png">
<img src="files/icons/female.png">
<img src="files/icons/unknown.png">
<p>
Gender refers to whether the Battler is Male,Female or Unknown.
Gender affects their initial attributes, access to gender-specific equipment and spriteset.
Certain enemies target one gender over the other making this an important factor to consider in some battles.
Golems and Abyssals are automatically of Unknown gender.
</p>
	<h3>3.1.1.4 Elemental Affinity</h3>
<p>
The Elemental Affinity of the Battler. This is based on the individual elemental resistances of the
Actor. The element that the Battler has the highest resistance to is usually one's elemental affinity,
but there are exceptions to this rule (See <a href= "gdd-6.0.html#6.3">Elemental Affinity</a> for details).
</p>
	<h3>3.1.1.3 Class</h3>
<p>
The class of the Battler. This determines the attribute growth on level up, the equipment that can
be worn, the skills they learn and their general role in battle. 
For Humans, this is known as their Archetype.
For Monsters, this is known as their Genus.
For Golems, this is known as their Model.
</p>
	<h3>3.1.1.4 Sub-Class</h3>
<p>
The Sub-class of the Battler. Can be accquired after level 25. The unit can now access some skills
of the Sub-Class and can wear the equipment of the Sub-Class. In some cases, their attribute
increases on level up also change.
For Humans, this is known as their Sub-Archetype.
For Monsters, this is known as their Sub-Genus.
For Golems, this is not applicable.
</p>

<h1><a name="3.2">3.2 Humans</a></h1>
<p>
Humans will make up the majority of The Cast. Humans have the most balanced attributes amongst all Actors.
Human grow by gaining levels (LVL) which is done by accumulating a specified amount of experience points (EXP)
from battles. Humans are also able to draw out the inherent “memories” of objects and so are able to acquire skills
from the equipment they wear. In addition, a Human’s elemental affinity and resistances are determined by the equipment
they wear.
</p>

<h2>3.2.1 Archetype</h2>
<p>
Archetype refers to an Actor's preferred role in a battle. A Human’s Archetype affects their attribute growth upon level up
and what equipment they can wear, hence what skills they are able to learn. There are five Archetypes: Tank, Rogue, Mule, 
Caster, and Healer.
</p>
	<h3>3.2.1.1 Tank</h3>
<p>
Tanks are hard-hitting, but slow physical attackers who can defend their allies.
Tanks have high HP/ATK/DEF, but low MP/SPD/MAG. Tanks can wield Spear-type weapons
(Javelin, Pike, Lance, Polearm) and wear Full-Helms, Plate Armor, and Great Shields.
</p>
	<h3>3.2.1.2 Rogue</h3>
<p>
Rogues are nimble fighters who can easily avoid enemy attacks and draw enemy aggro.
Rogues have high ATK/SPD/POT, but low HP/DEF/IMM. Rogues can wield Sword-type weapons
(Blade, Sabre, Rapier, Greatsword) and wear Caps, Lamellar Armor, and Bucklers.
</p>
	<h3>3.2.1.3 Mule</h3>
<p>Hat
Mules can use items with greater proficiency and have greater inventory space.
Mules have high HP/DEF/IMM,but low MP/ATK/MAG. Mules can wield Axe-type weapons 
(Handaxe, Hammer, Scythe, Greataxe) and wear Half-Helms, Fiber Armor and Gauntlets.
</p>
	<h3>3.2.1.4 Caster</h3>
<p>
Casters use offensive magic to damage and debilitate their enemies.
Caster have high MP/SPD/MAG, but low HP/ATK/DEF. Casters can wield Staff-type weapons
(Club, Rod, Wand, Mace) and wear Hoods, Mail Armor and Gloves.
</p>
	<h3>3.2.1.5 Healer</h3>
<p>
Healers use defensive magic to heal party members and bolster their abilities.
Healers have high MP/MAG, but low SPD/POT. Healers can wield Other-type weapons
(Knife,Bows,Flails,Knuckles) and wear Hats, Cloth Armor and Round Shields.
</p>

<h2>3.2.2 Persona (Sub-Class)</h2>
<p>
Once a Human reaches level 25, they will be able to take on a Persona by means of taking another Archetype to a smaller degree.
This will enable them to use a greater scope of equipment (hence learn new skills) and change their attribute growth upon leveling.
Their aesthetic look will also change slightly to match their specialization.
</p>

<h2>3.2.3 Assimilation (Learning Skills)</h2>
<p>
When a Human equips an item, they are able to use its inherent skills. However, if this item is unequipped, then the Actor is no longer able to use this skill.
To make the skills usable no matter what is equipped, the Actor must accumulate a specified amount of EXP while the item is equipped 
(e.g. the skill “Heavenly Indignation” is learned from Excalibur if 200000 EXP is accumulated while it is equipped). If by any chance the equipment is unequipped
during the learning, the amount of EXP earned thus far is noted in the Actor’s memory.
</p>

<h2>3.2.4 Transmigration (Re-Spec Method)</h2>
<p>
Once an Actor reaches level 50, they will have the choice of “Transmigration”, which resets the character back to level 1 and allows them to choose their 
Main Archetype (and eventually Sub Archetype) once again. All Skills stored in their memory (MEM) are retained, but attributes at the time of “Transmigration” will be halved.
Additionally, the Actor can change his/her name, appearance, and gender.
</p>
<p><a href="#top">[top]</a></p>

<h1><a name="3.3">3.3 Monsters</a></h1>
<p>
Monsters will make some unique additions to The Cast. Monsters have the greatest raw attributes and growth compared to Humans and Golems. Monsters also grow by gaining levels (LVL)
which is done by accumulating a specified amount of experience points (EXP). However, they are unable to wear equipment and grow at a much slower rate (more EXP required per level
up than other Actors). Monsters learn skills through genetic memories inherent to their respective genus.
</p>
<h2>3.3.1 Genus</h2>
<p>
Monsters are distinguished by their Species and Genus. Species refers to the type of Monster they are (e.g. Kobold, Troll, Cthulu etc.) which determines their initial attributes and
initial elemental affinity and resistances (if any). Genus refers to the group of Monsters they belong to. Their Genus affects their attribute growth and the genetic skill tree they
can access. There are nine Archetypes: Humanoid, Beast, Elemental, Dragon, Fiend, Fey, Specter, Nature and Abyssal.
</p>
	<h3>3.3.1.1 Humanoid</h3>
<p>
Humanoid monsters have human-like features, able to use tools and work in small groups to achieve common goals (balanced ALL).
