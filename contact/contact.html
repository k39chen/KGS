              <p>
                Adnan Alam is a game programmer of K4SM Game Development Team. He is 
                responsible for applications required for use by both designers and developers,
                among which are the Tilemap Editor, Choreographer, Battler Previewer,
                and many more.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the moment, he is working to earn a Bachelor's Degree in Computer 
                Engineering at the University of Waterloo. He has a dream of becoming 
                a Game Developer working in Japan with his role model, Tetsuya Nomura. 
                He loves to post on forums and troll on <a href="http:/www.youtube.com">
                YouTube</a> about things that seem <u>pointless</u> and <u>retarded</u>. Adnan loves 
                video games, especially JRPG's. He is obsessed with the upcoming 
                game Final Fantasy Versus XIII and will not stop obsessing over it (we
                seriously wish he would). Some of his favourite games include 
                Final Fantasy 9, Final Fantasy X, Gunstar Heroes, Infamous, Lord 
                Monarch, and several others.
